The source-state SHA above was `main` immediately before this documentation-only change. The listed workflows apply only to that exact SHA. This README is not a live `main`-ref indicator; query GitHub for the current `main` HEAD and obtain fresh exact-head checks after any commit.

Recent verified work hardened server-owned movement timing, added movement anti-cheat evidence, introduced touch joystick/HUD controls, and batched world entity markers per chunk. Material remaining risks include broader anti-cheat coverage for resource/attack/inventory/coordinate anomalies; complete player-facing mobile UX and accessibility; atlas/tilemap, LOD/culling and asset streaming; physical-device GPU profiling; progression/tutorial/quest UX; exploration/treasure discovery; transport benchmarking; and regional/global MMO topology and synchronization.

## 2. Verified Current Implementation

The following is supported by the current repository plus current project verification records. **Implemented** means code exists in the current repository. **Verified** means the implementation has supporting tests/CI/audit evidence; a green repository-wide CI run does not by itself prove production readiness.

### VERIFIED CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

- **Server-authoritative backend foundation**
  - Fastify HTTP API.
  - Authenticated WebSocket gameplay transport.
  - PostgreSQL persistence.
  - Transactional persistence and database locking for important mutations.
  - Server-side validation of persistent gameplay state.

- **World**
  - Deterministic 32×32 tile chunks.
  - Server-side chunk generation/cache.
  - HTTP/WebSocket world-chunk delivery.
  - Resource-node persistence/depletion and resource gathering paths.

- **Player and combat**
  - Server-side movement validation with server-owned monotonic movement timing and sequencing; combat resolution, cooldowns, stamina/block/dodge state, damage and creature AI.
  - Server-side ranged projectile lifecycle.
  - Request/replay protections on covered mutation paths.

- **Creatures**
  - Creature state and AI.
  - Capture/taming/party/AI flows represented in the current client/server protocol.
  - Creature persistence and ownership controls.

- **Bases**
  - Persistent base/storage state and authoritative storage mutation paths.

- **Crafting & economy**
  - Recipe/crafting services and protocol.
  - Authoritative inventory/resource mutation.
  - Gold Doubloon handling.
  - Shop, trading and auction paths.
  - Durable request/transaction protections on the hardened mutation paths covered by the current §92/§93 work.

- **Breeding**
  - Persistent breeding implementation and integration tests.

- **Ships / naval systems**
  - Persistent ship/fleet state and naval combat/inventory paths.

- **Guilds / social**
  - Guild state, guild-bank mutations, social systems and auction-related flows.

- **Tactical armies / realms / invasions**
  - Persistent armies.
  - Realm and territory state.
  - Realm AI/trade/reputation/fortress systems.
  - Invasion lifecycle, waves, roles, tactical controls and rewards.

- **World events / endgame**
  - Persistent world-event systems.
  - Endgame creature/reward flows.
  - Realm wars, guild battles and territory-season systems represented in the current repository and project records.

### IMPLEMENTED / NOT YET VERIFIED AS PRODUCTION ACCEPTANCE

The repository contains substantial client and gameplay functionality beyond the early combat foundation, but individual feature presence must not be confused with full production acceptance. The current audit identifies gaps in player-facing mobile UX/accessibility, broader anti-cheat coverage, rendering scalability, progression/quest UX, exploration/treasure discovery, transport benchmarking and global MMO topology.

### PARTIAL

- Player-facing mobile UX and accessibility are PARTIAL: touch joystick/HUD controls exist, but full production HUD, accessibility and quality/thermal controls remain incomplete.
- Production graphics/rendering optimisation is PARTIAL: per-chunk entity batching exists, but atlas/tilemap terrain, LOD/culling, asset streaming and physical-device GPU profiling remain.
- Anti-cheat movement evidence and security-event telemetry (broader resource/attack/inventory/coordinate detection remains incomplete).
- Broader anti-cheat detection for resource collection, attack frequency, coordinates and inventory mutation.
- Global/regional MMO topology and cross-server synchronisation.
- Full exploration/resource presentation and treasure-map gameplay.
- Player-facing progression/tutorial/quest UX.

These remain incomplete according to the current audit.

---

## 3. Prototype Client

### PROTOTYPE CLIENT

The current repository client under `client/` is a **Phaser 4.2.1 + TypeScript/Vite client**. It is the active prototype/runtime client in the repository.

Repository evidence shows it currently demonstrates:

- Authentication and authenticated WebSocket connection.
- Server-authoritative world/chunk rendering.
- Keyboard movement and combat controls.
- Touch combat controls.
- Creature capture, taming, party and AI interactions.
- Resource gathering.
- Crafting, shop purchase and trading result flows.
- Guild/social/base/breeding/ship/realm/strategy/endgame system-panel flows.
- Invasion tactical overlay and actions.
- Client-side parsing/validation of server messages before use.

### Known prototype limitations

The current audit shows that the client is **not a production mobile client**:

- Keyboard remains a primary movement path.
- A complete virtual joystick/mobile control system is not implemented.
- The current system panel is developer-style rather than a finished player UX.
- Player-facing quest/tutorial/progression presentation is incomplete.
- Accessibility and quality/thermal controls are incomplete.
- Phaser rendering still uses many individual graphics objects rather than the required production atlas/tilemap/GPU-batched/LOD pipeline.
- Current WebSocket transport is suitable for the present prototype but is not evidence of the PDF's production large-battle mobile transport target.
- The current client must not be interpreted as production-ready merely because it builds or passes CI.

## 4. Production Client

### PRODUCTION CLIENT STATUS: NOT IMPLEMENTED AS A SEPARATE PRODUCTION RUNTIME

No separate production client/runtime is present in the current repository.

### Intended architecture/boundary

The Master Build Prompt's preferred client direction is:

**TypeScript + Phaser/WebGPU-capable renderer + WebGL fallback + GPU-accelerated asset pipeline**, with evaluation of Godot, Unity or Unreal only if technical evaluation shows Phaser cannot meet the target.

The production boundary is:

- Client: presentation, input, interpolation and server-state rendering.
- Server: authoritative movement, combat, inventory, currency, creature ownership, progression and persistent world state.
- Reliable transactional operations remain server-authoritative.
- Production rendering/networking choices must be validated against representative Android/iOS performance requirements.

### Actually implemented

- TypeScript client exists.
- Phaser runtime exists.
- WebSocket gameplay transport exists.
- Server-authoritative backend boundary exists.

### Designed but not implemented / planned migration work

- Full production mobile HUD/input system.
- Production renderer/asset/atlas/LOD pipeline.
- Adaptive quality, thermal and battery management.
- Production-scale transport abstraction and measured UDP/QUIC-oriented transport evaluation.
- Global/regional server topology, cross-server state synchronisation and battle instancing.
- Full production player progression/onboarding UX.

No Unity production client is claimed because none is present in the current repository.

## 5. Future Gates / Planned Work

The project retains a **sequential gate/phase model**. Phase 16 is the latest numbered phase represented by the current project records.

The PDF does **not** provide an authoritative Gate 17 definition. Its material after Phase 16 continues with broader requirements covering code quality, error handling, logging/observability, CI/CD, Docker/configuration, migrations, API/state design, ECS/AI/pathfinding, save consistency, duplication/disconnect recovery, data-driven content, performance/load testing, rendering/network/server topology, world partitioning, LOD, asset streaming, mobile/GPU/tick/interest management and cross-server synchronisation.

These are **FUTURE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED** requirements unless separately evidenced. They must not be presented as completed current implementation.

Current high-priority future work recorded by the audit:

1. Expand anti-cheat detection beyond movement to resource collection, attack frequency, coordinates and inventory mutations.
2. Complete production mobile HUD, player-facing UX, accessibility and quality/thermal controls.
3. Implement atlas/tilemap terrain, LOD/culling, asset streaming and physical-device GPU profiling.
4. Complete tutorial, quest and progression UX.
5. Benchmark transport options and mobile-network behavior.
6. Complete authoritative treasure/resource discovery and excavation flows.
7. Implement and load-test regional/global MMO topology, cross-server synchronization and distributed battle instancing.

No future item is described here as implemented merely because it appears in the PDF.

## 6. Verification Evidence

### Last verified source-state evidence (before documentation change)

**Verified source-state SHA:** `d4de5d278369b5dc3d57aeee13c86bb4bec70c8e`  
**Verification date:** 2026-10-09

- verify run `37915489570` — **PASS**
- sustained-load run `37915489672` — **PASS**
- static-security run `37915489593` — **PASS**

These results apply only to the exact source-state SHA above; they do not verify later documentation commits or current main.

The independent audit status remains **NOT AUDIT-PASS / NOT PRODUCTION-READY**. Movement authority timing has since been hardened and movement anti-cheat evidence added; broader anomaly detection, full production mobile UX/accessibility, renderer LOD/asset streaming, player progression UX and global/regional MMO topology remain incomplete.

### Evidence boundary

- Historical gate verification remains historical.
- CI from another SHA is never current-main evidence.
- Any HEAD change invalidates current-head verification claims until the new exact HEAD is independently verified.
- Documentation-only changes must not be described as re-verifying gameplay behaviour merely because CI is green.
- If exact-head evidence is unavailable, the state is **UNVERIFIED**, not PASS.

---

## 7. Development Rules

- **Server authority:** clients send intent and render authoritative results; persistent gameplay state is not client-authoritative.
- **No fake completion:** never mark a feature complete without repository and verification evidence.
- **No placeholders:** no TODO/FIXME/fake/simulated implementation presented as completed functionality.
- **Verification order:** targeted tests → affected integration → regression/full suite → typecheck → lint → build → CI → performance/security → independent audit.
- **Exact SHA discipline:** every current verification statement identifies the exact commit; evidence is never transferred across HEAD changes.
- **Independent audit:** implementation and verification claims must be independently checked before completion.
- **Failure learning:** every failure is recorded as **failure → root cause → corrective action → prevention rule** and the prevention rule is applied to subsequent work.
- **Two-GPT coordination:** read Notion before work, verify GitHub state, resolve ownership, avoid duplicate work, update Notion after meaningful changes, and stop when ownership/state/evidence conflicts.
- **Frozen gates:** do not reopen a frozen gate without reproducible regression/dependency evidence.
- **Sequential progression:** do not invent a future gate definition from assumptions or historical chat.
